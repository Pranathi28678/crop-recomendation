## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting Parkinson's disease. By analyzing various features, the model provides a classification that can help in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranathi28678/parkinsons_disease_prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd parkinsons_disease_prediction
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Parkinson's_Disease__Age.ipynb"
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `parkinsons_updrs.data.csv`. It contains various features related to biomedical voice measurements that are used to distinguish healthy individuals from those with Parkinson's disease.

## Model Training

The notebook includes code for training a machine learning model using the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation are displayed within the notebook, including classification reports and performance metrics.
